Test Setups  10/13/2020
-------------------------------------------------
Driver_NN_PID_6_1  (this uses a CNN)
Training files:  training.csv  -- random, near target MAP
Controller output: control.csv  -- needs to be emptied every run unless keep previous data
Generally, results should appear on the screen.
For more details about the CNN run, set dbg4 = True.

Validation: Use random impulses: 

Training file setup: 

Module test for NN:  NN_for_PID_1
-------------------------------------------------
Driver RNN_PID_6_2  (this uses an RNN)
Training files:  RNNtraining.csv  -- random, near target MAP
Controller output: control.csv  -- needs to be emptied every run unless keep previous data
Generally, results should appear on the screen.


Validation: Use random impulses: 
            Or noisy sinusoids generated internally with setting, sine = True

Training file setup: Setup RNN_setup_1_2 makes RNN_training.csv
                     Or: RNN_setup_1_0 which makes true and false but steady levels

Module test for NN:  NN_for_PID_5 and data from newTimeSeriesNN (noisy sinusoids)
                Or:  TimeSeriesNN  for random glitches.  Needs output data file.
-------------------------------------------------
Driver_Kramer_Tables_1_4  (table-driven)

Validation: Use random impulses: 
            Or noisy sinusoids generated internally with setting, sine = True

Training file setup:  

Module test:  None
-------------------------------------------------
Driver_Fuzzy_1_2   (fuzzy logic)

Validation: Use random impulses: 
            Or noisy sinusoids generated internally with setting, sine = True

Training file setup:  

Module test:  None
=================================================
NOTES:
Fluid loss file, bleeding.csv, needs to be generated by:
Generally the fluid loss capabilities exist in all the Drivers, but not well tested yet.
TimeSeriesNN glitches needs creation of output for above tests.  Use Glitches instead.
Glitches generates an output per TimeSeriesNN
